# Neural Networks
This repository is written with Java. It holds the code for the class I took in my junior year of high school for the Honors Advanced Topics Computer Science: Neural Networks class.

## Running Code
To run the Perceptron in the directory of interest, open the terminal and type
```
cd DIRECTORY_TO_RUN
```

In the directories, there are .cfg files that specify what settings each Perceptron uses.

Then type
```
javac Main.java
java Main
```
